[pfm-calculation.js](/myAssets/js/pfm-calculation.js) | Script which dynamically calulates dates within the Liturgical Calendar

* The PFM date is a central refference point.
* Many feast days and seasonal windows vary from year to year depending on when Easter is and on the sunday certain fests are adjusted for.
* In my opinon this code is not effient, but the cumbersom steps I took reflect how the Fiest days are deduced. They are not just 'hollidays on a calendar', they are proportional to astronomical and geological patterns. Once uppon a time, people paired their faith to the rules of nature and regional cultural habits.
