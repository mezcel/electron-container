[pfm-calculation.js](/myAssets/js/pfm-calculation.js) | Script which dynamically calculates dates within the Liturgical Calendar

* The PFM date is a central reference point.
* Many feast days and seasonal windows vary from year to year depending on when Easter is and on the Sunday certain fests are adjusted for.
* In my opinion this code is not efficient, but the cumbersome steps I took reflect how the Feast days are deduced. They are not just 'holidays on a calendar', they are proportional to astronomical and geological patterns. Once upon a time, people paired their faith to the rules of nature and regional cultural habits.
* The PFM algorithm was modeled from [assa.org](https://www.assa.org.au/edm)
