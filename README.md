# electron-container

Node Js bench brainstorming

Whats going on:

* Messing with Electron and Socket.io. No Mongo.

* This app does nothing. It was just to have a skeleton to pick at.

* The goal is to make a reusable feature to add to some other web app projects. Not sure if I will use socktes to trigger remote controlls or just screen displays ex:text.

Todo:

* The standalone Express component is a bit upsidedown, going to flip it.

* Going to add EJS to the Express compnent.

```sh
# install dependancies 
npm install

# activate app ans server
npm start
```
